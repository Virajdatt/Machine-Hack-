## Problem Description

The last two decades have witnessed a significant change in how consumers purchase products and express their experience/opinions in reviews, posts, and content across platforms. These online reviews are not only useful to reflect customers’ sentiment towards a product but also help businesses fix gaps and find potential opportunities which could further influence future purchases. 

We will develop a machine learning/ deep learning model that can analyse customers sentiments based on their reviews and feedback.
